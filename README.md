siglearn: Noisy Machine Learning
================================

Siglearn is an experimental repository for providing a well-defined,
scikit-learn-style API for performing modeling and machine learning tasks
on noisy data.

Often in scientific detector data, we have some estimate of the error in
observed points. Unfortunately, most classic machine learning approaches
are not built with data errors in mind. Siglearn is an attempt to begin
collecting implementations of algorithms which do handle data errors.

The code is very much under development; if you're interested in helping,
I would love your contribution!
